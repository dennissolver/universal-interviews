A comprehensive guide to configuring AI interview panels for Connexions AI Interview Platform.

## Overview

When creating a new interview panel, you'll work with **Sandra**, our AI research design partner. Sandra doesn't just collect information — she collaborates with you to design the perfect interview, suggests questions based on your research goals, and helps you customize your AI interviewer's persona.

**New: Visual Review Before Creation**

After designing your panel with Sandra, you'll see everything on screen where you can:
- Review all questions and settings
- Make any final edits
- Choose your interviewer's voice and name
- Click "Create" when you're ready

---

## The Creation Flow

```
1. Talk to Sandra          →  Collaborative design conversation
2. Sandra saves draft      →  All settings captured
3. Review on screen        →  See & edit everything visually  
4. Click "Create Panel"    →  AI interviewer goes live
```
